# Hi there! 🙋‍♂️ 
My name is @chefleo and I am an entry-level web3 engineer with a passion for building decentralized applications (DApps). 

I have recently completed my bachelor's degree in computer science and have been actively learning about blockchain technology and web3 development through various online courses and personal projects.
I have experience working with a variety of blockchain platforms, including [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) 🦄, and have familiarity with [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/) 💎 and other programming languages. 
In my previous role as a software engineer, I worked on projects ranging from full-stack web development to data analysis and machine learning.

I am always looking to learn more and improve my skills, and I am excited to join a team where I can grow as a web3 engineer and 
make a meaningful contribution. In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date on the latest developments in the blockchain space 🌌 and contributing to open-source projects on GitHub 💻.

Some of my notable personal projects include a DApp called [BuyMeACoffee] ☕️ built with Hardhat and Solidity, deployed on the Goerli testnet and using the Alchemy API to interact with the Ethereum network. 
I have also created several clones of popular websites and apps, including [Hulu](https://github.com/chefleo/hulu-clone) 📺, [Amazon](https://github.com/chefleo/amazon-clone) 🛒, [Spotify](https://github.com/chefleo/spotify-next-clone) 🎧, [Instagram](https://github.com/chefleo/instagram-clone) 📸, [Airbnb](https://github.com/chefleo/airbnb-clone) 🏡, [Slack](https://github.com/chefleo/slack-clone) 💬, and [Netflix](https://github.com/chefleo/netflix-clone) 🎥, using technologies such as React 💻, Next.js, and Vercel.

In addition to my technical skills, I have experience working on open-source projects, including contributing to the translation of the HTTP Archive - Web Almanac 2020 and writing articles on topics such as the [Libra blockchain](https://simon-digiorgio.medium.com/la-blockchain-di-libra-e8b1e243fcbd) 🔗 and its [Move language](https://simon-digiorgio.medium.com/il-linguaggio-move-1b0a996fe5c9) 🌀.

I am excited to join a team where I can utilize my skills and continue learning about the exciting world of web3 development. 

Thank you for considering my profile. 🙏
